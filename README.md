# Welcome to Python Repository

## Machine Learning

### Description
This section introduces fundamental machine learning techniques, focusing on regression and classification models in supervised learning and clustering models in unsupervised learning. Emphasis is placed on understanding model bias and variance relationships, and evaluating model quality. Additionally, students gain practical experience in data preprocessing and multidimensional data visualization using Python's pandas and scikit-learn libraries.

## Robot Navigation Server

### Description
The Robot Navigation Server project involves creating a server that authenticates and navigates multiple remote robots to the center of a coordinate system. Each robot starts from a random position and attempts to reach the [0,0] coordinate to retrieve a secret message. The server communicates with robots using a specific text-based protocol, handles obstacles, and manages various error scenarios.

### Folder Contents
- **robot_navigation_server/**: Contains code and documentation for the robot navigation server project.
