# Statistical Analysis and Creativity Score

## Description

Explore the intersection of statistical analysis techniques and creativity score evaluation based on different motivational factors. This section delves into various statistical and probability concepts, providing insights into:

- Analysis of observed variables and variability deviations.
- Parameter estimation for normal, exponential, and uniform distributions.
- Generation of random samples based on estimated parameters.
- Comparison of histograms between simulated and observed data.
- Calculation of confidence intervals for mean values.

The project also evaluates creativity scores using algorithms that consider different types of motivation, revealing how motivational factors influence creative outputs.
